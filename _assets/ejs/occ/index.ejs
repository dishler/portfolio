                    <div class="p-work-overview__description">In our project, we created a Customer Journey Map to
                      gain a better understanding of our users' experience with our
                      product. We mapped out the different stages of the customer journey, from initial awareness
                      to post-purchase evaluation,
                      and identified key touchpoints and pain points. Through this activity, we discovered areas
                      where the customer experience
                      could be improved and identified opportunities to enhance the customer journey. This helped
                      us to create a more
                      user-centered solution and improve overall satisfaction with our product.

                      Information Architecture</h3>
                    <div class="p-work-overview__description">In the OCC project, the Information Architecture
                      (IA) was an important aspect of the UX design process. Our team
                      conducted a thorough analysis of the existing IA and determined the key elements that needed
                      to be included in the new
                      design. The main goal of our IA work was to create a clear and intuitive structure that
                      would enable users to easily
                      navigate and find the information they needed.
                      To achieve this, we developed a hierarchical organization of the content and functionality,
                      breaking down the site into
                      categories, sections, and sub-pages. This helped us to create a clear and logical path for
                      users to follow as they moved
                      through the site. Additionally, we used clear and concise labeling to help users understand
                      the purpose of each section
                      and what they could expect to find there.
                      The IA work was also informed by our user research and testing, which allowed us to validate
                      our design decisions and
                      ensure that our IA was meeting the needs of our users. As a result, we were able to create a
                      highly effective and
                      intuitive IA that helped users achieve their goals quickly and easily.

                    <div class="p-work-overview__description"> The OCC project involved the creation of 40 user
                      flows, designed for both web and native applications. Our goal was to
                      create an intuitive and seamless experience for the users by mapping out their journey
                      through the platform, taking into
                      consideration their goals, pain points, and preferred method of communication. To achieve
                      this, our team worked closely
                      with the business analysts to understand the users' needs and developed detailed user flows
                      for each step of the
                      process. These user flows were tested with real users to validate our assumptions and ensure
                      that the platform was
                      user-friendly and efficient. The final product was a platform that not only met the users'
                      needs but also helped
                      professionals in the construction industry to save time, make money, and navigate compliance
                      and regulations with ease.

                      wireframes for both native and web platforms, totaling about 250 screens.
                      These wireframes served as a blueprint for the design and development of the platform,
                      ensuring a seamless user
                      experience and efficient navigation. The wireframes were carefully crafted to meet the
                      unique needs of the roofing
                      industry and provide a solution to the challenges of obtaining accurate, up-to-date roofing
                      codes. The result was a
                      comprehensive, user-friendly platform that streamlined the process of finding the right
                      roofing codes and other
                      information for contractors, adjusters, and insurance providers.

                    <div class="p-work-overview__description">The OCC project aimed to create a user-friendly
                      platform for the roofing industry. The team successfully developed a
                      design that simplifies the process of obtaining and utilizing roofing code reports, making
                      compliance and regulations
                      easier to navigate. The platform was well-received by users and achieved its goal of
                      increasing conversions from Starter
                      to Pro plans.
                      <h4>Key takeaways from this project are:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>User testing doesn't end after development. Design
                          is a constant iteration of improving the experience for the end user.
                          Always find ways to collect and listen to your user's feedback.
                        </li>
                        <li>Involve engineering upfront. This helps to reduce any rework later on as an understanding
                          of the technical limitations
                          upfront will help to inform your design strategy.</li>
