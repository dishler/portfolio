                        create a user-friendly platform for vendors and admins with clear
                        data visualization and an intuitive Protogetic Filter. This filter had to reduce the time spent
                        searching for important
                        information, such as safety ratings, certifications, and detailed specifications, from hours to
                        just a few seconds.
                        Additionally, the platform had to cater to the diverse needs of all stakeholders in the security
                        building and
                        infrastructure construction industries by providing a central hub that is easy to navigate and
                        access for all users,

                        information architecture,
                        and a flexible design system. Interactive prototypes were created for testing and improvement,

                        I was responsible for designing the Amity platform from the ground up. I led the specification
                        discovery process,
                        analyzed user flows, and created the information architecture to ensure the platform met the
                        needs of all stakeholders.
                        I designed wireframes and the visual user interface (UI), focusing on usability and user
                        experience to create an
                        intuitive and easy-to-use solution. Throughout the project, I worked closely with the
                        development team to ensure the
                        platform was built according to the design specifications and met the requirements of the
                        client. My attention to detail
                        and dedication to creating a high-quality product resulted in a platform that effectively
                        balances safety, convenience,
                        and independence for all users.
